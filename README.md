# TUTORIALS
This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to Python, to help the reader to understand the basic memory management and the bases of Object Oriented Programing.


## How to begin.
Take a look at the folder  

  - Python/Before_OOP

Understand and master
 - First-class functions.
 - Closures
 - Decorators
 
 These are some of the most important features that Python offers. If you understand these concepts Object-Oriented Programming will be simpler in Python.
 This will help you to program more efficiently, and add extra functionality to your code. You will be able to help other programmers in your team to easily
 find out how your code has been developed.

## Object Oriented Programing (OOP).

After the basics, there are scripts, with specifics about OOP, how to work with classes and objects, different kinds of methods and other concepts, that will allow you to understand python.
